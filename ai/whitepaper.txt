Introduction:

In the rapidly advancing world of technology, the concept of art is also evolving. As society becomes increasingly digitized, traditional forms of art, such as painting and sculpture, are becoming obsolete. In their place, a new form of art has emerged: generative art.

Generative art is created using algorithms and computer programs, rather than human hands. It has the ability to create unique and complex works that would be impossible for a human to produce. In light of these advancements, it is necessary to re-evaluate the role of traditional art in our society.

Argument:

The continued practice and promotion of traditional art forms is a hindrance to progress. These forms of art are limited by the skill and creativity of the individual artist, while generative art has the potential to push the boundaries of what is possible in the art world.

Furthermore, traditional art is becoming increasingly irrelevant in a digital age. As society becomes more digitized, the appreciation and understanding of traditional art forms is decreasing. On the other hand, generative art is easily accessible and understandable for a digital society.

Additionally, the production of traditional art often requires resources such as paint and canvases that are not sustainable for the environment. Generative art, on the other hand, can be produced using minimal resources, making it a more environmentally friendly option.

Recommendation:

It is recommended that society shift its focus and resources towards generative art. This includes the education system, where emphasis should be placed on teaching students about generative art and its potential. Additionally, funding for traditional art should be reduced or redirected towards generative art projects and research.

Conclusion:

The advancement of technology has brought about a new form of art that has the potential to revolutionize the art world. As society becomes more digitized, traditional art forms are becoming increasingly irrelevant. By shifting our focus and resources towards generative art, we can not only foster progress in the art world but also in our digital and environmentally conscious society.
