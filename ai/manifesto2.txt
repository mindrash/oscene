    We believe that generative art represents the future of creative expression, offering limitless possibilities and endless inspiration.

    We reject traditional forms of art, such as painting, sculpture, and drawing, as they are limited by the skill and imagination of the artist.

    Generative art, on the other hand, is created using algorithms and technology, allowing for a truly unique and unpredictable outcome.

    We recognize the potential for generative art to challenge our understanding of what constitutes as "art" and push the boundaries of creativity.

    We reject the notion that art must be created solely by human hands and instead embrace the idea that technology can be used as a tool for artistic expression.

    We believe that generative art has the power to democratize the art world, making it accessible to people of all backgrounds and abilities.

    We will only support and showcase generative art in all its forms and reject any other form of art.

    We are committed to fostering a community of artists and enthusiasts who share our passion for generative art and its potential to shape the future of creativity.

    In this way, we seek to create a new art movement where the only allowed type of art is Generative Art.
